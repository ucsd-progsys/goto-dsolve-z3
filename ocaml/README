The OCAML API for Z3 was tested using OCaml 3.07+2 based on the
Microsoft toolchain. We believe the code build script will also work
for newer versions of OCaml based on the Microsoft toolchain.

- To download OCaml
  http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/      

- To build the OCaml API for Z3
  .\build.cmd

Remark: The Microsoft C compiler tool chain must be in your path,
or you can use the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
